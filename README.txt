This Android app simulates a game of chess using a two-dimensional array of buttons.
When the app is opened, it sets the pieces (both black and white) in their default places.
To play, the user taps on the piece they would like to use. The spaces that the piece can move to are colored green. The user can move the piece by tapping on a green space. If the user taps on a space the piece cannot move to, the piece will not move.

Abbreviations for pieces:
KG - King
Q - Queen
B - Bishop
K - Knight
R - Rook
P - Pawn
